% Macros for 2 and 3 player games in strategic form and for a 
% similar, bordered table with single entries in each cell.
% Each handles an arbitrary number of rows and columns and with 
% payoffs, for the two-player game, in the lower-left and 
% upper-right corners of each cell.  Based on tabular and tabularx 
% environments so it can enclosed in alignment (e.g.  centering) 
% and/or float (e.g.  table) environments. 
%
% The sfgame (2 player) and Sfgame (3 player) environments have 4 
% parameters:
% #1: optional tabular vertical alignment position argument:
%       t (top line of table aligned with baseline of external text)
%       b (bottom line of table aligned with external text)
%       none (table centered vertically on external text)
% #2: (length spec) - the width of the first (row titles) column
% #3: the number of actions for the column player;
% #4: (length spec) - the width of each of the action columns;
%
% Eg usage: Prisoner's dilemma
% \begin{sfgame}{.6in}{2}{.8in}
%     \players{Row}{Col}   \col{Coop}   \col{Fink}
%     \row{Coop}           \pay{2}{2}   \pay{0}{3}
%     \row{Fink}           \pay{3}{0}   \pay{1}{1}
